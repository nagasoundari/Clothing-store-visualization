# Clothing store visualization

This project is a part of my MSIM coursework(Business Intelligence Systems). It includes an end to end BI system development. I started it from the scratch of making star schema using visio. Then, using SSIS package, staging of the database is done. Later I used SQL queries to populate the dimension and fact tables. Finally many business questions were answered using Tableau visualizations. This folder includes the tableau visualizations. I worked on the project individually untill making visualizations. The presnetation to my cohorts was done as a group.
