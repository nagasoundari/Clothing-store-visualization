# Clothing store visualization

This project is a part of my MSIM coursework(Business Intelligence Systems). It includes an end to end BI system development. I started it from the scratch of making star schema using visio. Then, using SSIS package, staging of the database is done. Later I used SQL queries to populate the dimension and fact tables. Finally many business questions were answered using Tableau visualizations. This folder includes the tableau visualizations. I worked on this project individually untill making visualizations. The presentation to my cohorts was done as a group.

The dataset has millions of rows with details of customers, stores, their location, products etc., There were three main categories of products, which are Women clothing and accessories, Men clothing and accessories and children's apparel. I mainly concentrated on analysis of children's apparel and the way to boostup their sales.
